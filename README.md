# DD-comp-challenge-2
For this project I was tasked to recreate an image using only CSS and HTML. We were not given any assets thus were free to be creative with the theme and colors. We were also not given any breakpoints so we had to think about where to best place them. In my comp I decided to challenge myself and not use flexbox or grid. Here are the results.
